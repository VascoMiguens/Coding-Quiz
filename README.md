# Coding-Quiz

## Description 
This project is the fourth challenge of a bootcamp where students had to develop a code quiz where they had to implement:
  * To create a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions
  * The user will submit his final result and it will be save into the local storage
  * After the submission the user can check the highest scores recorded

## Rules
  * The time is set by multiplying the number of questions by 15
  * The final result will be the total number of questions that were answered correctly added to the time remaining at the end of the quiz
